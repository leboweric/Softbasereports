# Sales Dashboard UX Review and Recommendations

**To:** CEO & Sales Executives
**From:** Manus AI
**Date:** February 12, 2026

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive user experience (UX) review of the current Sales Dashboard and presents recommendations for a redesign tailored to the needs of a CEO and Sales Executive audience. The goal is to create a more intuitive, insightful, and actionable dashboard that aligns with the design patterns established in the recently improved Rental, Parts, and Service department dashboards.

## 2. High-Level Recommendations

The current Sales Dashboard is a collection of various sales-related metrics and charts. While it contains a wealth of information, it lacks a clear narrative and focus for a high-level executive audience. The proposed redesign focuses on three key areas:

*   **Clarity and Focus:** Reorganize the dashboard into a tabbed layout to separate distinct areas of sales performance, making it easier to navigate and digest information.
*   **Actionable Insights:** Introduce a new set of Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards and an "Action Items" section to provide a clear, at-a-glance overview of sales health and highlight areas requiring immediate attention.
*   **Consistency:** Align the Sales Dashboard with the UX patterns of the other department dashboards to create a cohesive and predictable user experience across the application.

## 3. Detailed Analysis and Recommendations

### 3.1. Overall Layout and Structure

The current Sales Dashboard is a single, long page with multiple charts and tables. This can be overwhelming and makes it difficult to find specific information. We recommend a tabbed layout similar to the other department dashboards.

**Proposed Tabs:**

*   **Overview:** A high-level summary of sales performance, including key KPI cards, an "Action Items" section, and a primary revenue chart.
*   **Equipment Sales:** Detailed analysis of new and used equipment sales.
*   **Aftermarket Analysis:** A breakdown of aftermarket sales performance (Parts, Service, Rental).
*   **Sales Team Performance:** Metrics and leaderboards related to the sales team's performance.
*   **Customers:** Customer-related metrics and analysis.

### 3.2. KPI Cards

The current KPI cards are a good starting point, but they can be improved to provide a more comprehensive and executive-friendly overview. We propose a new set of KPI cards for the "Overview" tab, inspired by the effective KPI cards in the Rental and Parts dashboards.

**Proposed KPI Cards:**

| KPI                  | Description                                                                 | Rationale                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total YTD Sales**      | Year-to-date total sales revenue.                                           | Provides a clear, high-level view of overall sales performance against the annual plan.                         |
| **YTD Gross Profit**   | Year-to-date gross profit.                                                  | Highlights the profitability of sales, a key metric for executives.                                             |
| **Blended GP%**        | The blended gross profit percentage across all sales.                       | A crucial indicator of overall profitability and pricing strategy effectiveness.                                 |
| **Equipment Sales**    | YTD revenue from equipment sales.                                           | Tracks the performance of the primary sales driver.                                                             |
| **Aftermarket Sales**  | YTD revenue from aftermarket sales (Parts, Service, Rental).                | Provides visibility into the performance of recurring revenue streams.                                          |

### 3.3. Charts and Visualizations

The current charts are informative but can be better organized and presented. We recommend the following changes:

*   **Combined Revenue Chart:** The "Overview" tab should feature a single, prominent chart showing the overall monthly sales revenue and gross profit margin trend, similar to the primary chart in the Parts and Service dashboards. This chart should also include the "Include current month" toggle.
*   **Equipment Sales Chart:** The "Equipment Sales" tab should feature a chart dedicated to new and used equipment sales, showing revenue, gross profit, and unit counts.
*   **Aftermarket Sales by Stream:** The "Aftermarket Analysis" tab should include a chart that breaks down aftermarket sales by stream (Parts, Service, Rental), allowing for a clear comparison of their performance.

### 3.4. Action Items

A key feature of the improved department dashboards is the "Action Items" card, which surfaces critical issues that require attention. We recommend adding a similar card to the Sales Dashboard's "Overview" tab.

**Proposed Action Items:**

*   **GP% Below Target:** Alert when the blended gross profit percentage falls below the target.
*   **Declining Sales Trend:** Highlight a negative trend in overall sales revenue.
*   **Key Customer Risk:** Flag when a top customer is identified as being at risk of churn.

## 4. Branding and UI

Upon approval of the UX recommendations, we will proceed with implementing the changes and applying the new "AI First Operations" branding, including updating the color scheme, logos, and typography to align with the new brand identity and the `aiop.one` domain.

## 5. Conclusion

The proposed redesign of the Sales Dashboard will provide a more focused, insightful, and actionable experience for the CEO and Sales Executive audience. By aligning with the UX patterns of the other department dashboards, we will create a more cohesive and user-friendly analytics platform. We are confident that these changes will empower the sales leadership to make more informed decisions and drive business growth.
