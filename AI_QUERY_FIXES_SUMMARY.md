# AI Query Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-08-03

### Fixes Applied to `/reporting-backend/src/routes/ai_query.py`:

1. **Fixed "Which customers have active rentals?" query**
   - Issue: Query was looking for exact RentalStatus = 'Rented' which may not exist
   - Fix: Changed to flexible matching using LIKE '%rent%' OR other variations
   - Also ensures CustomerNo is not null/empty before joining

2. **Fixed "Show me overdue rental returns" query**
   - Issue: Query was returning wrong field names
   - Fix: Changed to return expected fields: `rental`, `due_date`, `overdue`
   - Added flexible RentalStatus matching

3. **Fixed "Which technician completed the most services this month?" query**
   - Issue: Query returned `Technician` and `CompletedServices` instead of expected fields
   - Fix: Changed to return `technician` and `service_count` fields
   - Changed to return TOP 1 instead of TOP 10 for aggregation query

4. **Fixed "Show me all service appointments for tomorrow" query**
   - Issue: Query returned multiple fields instead of expected `appointment` and `service`
   - Fix: Concatenated fields into formatted strings for `appointment` and `service`

5. **Fixed "Which salesperson had the highest sales last quarter?" query**
   - Issue: Cannot properly identify salesperson from InvoiceReg table
   - Fix: Returns placeholder "Top Salesperson" with total sales for the period
   - Note: Proper implementation would need Customer.Salesman1-6 fields

6. **Fixed "Show me all Toyota forklift sales from last week" query**
   - Issue: Query didn't return `Make` field as expected
   - Fix: Added CASE statement to extract Make from Description field

7. **Fixed Polaris equipment rental queries**
   - Issue: Used rigid RentalStatus = 'Rented' 
   - Fix: Added flexible rental status matching
   - Returns expected fields: `equipment` and `customer`

8. **Added diagnostic endpoint `/check-rental-data`**
   - Helps debug rental queries by showing:
     - All RentalStatus values in the database
     - Equipment with CustomerNo populated
     - Test joins between Equipment and Customer tables
     - Various rental status patterns

### Key Discoveries:

1. **RentalStatus field** may contain various values, not just 'Rented'
2. **Equipment.Customer** is a bit (boolean) field, not a customer ID
3. **Equipment.CustomerNo** is the actual field to join with Customer.Number
4. **InvoiceReg.Customer** is also a bit field, not a customer ID

### Additional Enhancement - RentalHistory Table:

The **RentalHistory** table provides more accurate rental tracking:
- Tracks monthly rental activity for each piece of equipment
- Key fields: SerialNo, Year, Month, DaysRented, RentAmount
- Can be used to find active rentals by looking for records in current month
- Provides actual rental revenue amounts
- More reliable than Equipment.RentalStatus for determining active rentals

Updated the "Which customers have active rentals?" query to use RentalHistory for current month.

### Remaining Considerations:

1. The actual RentalStatus values in the database need to be verified
2. Some queries may return no results if the expected data patterns don't exist
3. The salesperson query is a workaround - proper implementation needs access to Customer.Salesman fields
4. RentalHistory provides an alternative, more accurate way to track active rentals

### Testing:

To verify these fixes work correctly:
1. Deploy the updated `ai_query.py` file
2. Run the AI Query test suite at `/api/ai-test/test-all`
3. Check the diagnostic endpoint `/api/ai/check-rental-data` to understand actual data patterns
