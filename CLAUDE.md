# Softbase Reports Project Context

## Overview
This is a comprehensive reporting system for Softbase Evolution, a heavy equipment management system. The project consists of a React frontend and Flask backend that connects to an Azure SQL Server database.

## Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Recharts
- **Backend**: Flask, PyMSSQL, JWT authentication
- **Database**: Azure SQL Server (schema: ben002)
- **Deployment**: Netlify (frontend), Railway (backend)

## Database Schema Information
To get the complete database schema:
1. Navigate to Database Explorer in the web app
2. Click "Export JSON" button to download complete schema
3. The JSON file contains all tables, columns, relationships, and sample data

### Key Tables:
- **InvoiceReg**: Invoice records with revenue data
- **WO**: Work orders (Type: S=Service, R=Rental, etc.)
- **Customer**: Customer information and balances
- **Equipment**: Equipment inventory and rental status
- **Parts**: Main parts inventory table (NOT NationalParts - see Important Discovery below)
- **WOParts**: Parts used on work orders (includes BOQty for backorders)
- **InvoiceArchive**: Archived invoice data
- **InvoiceSales**: Sales line items

### Important Fields:
- **SaleCode**: Department identifier (e.g., 'SVE' for Service, 'PRT' for Parts)
- **Department**: Direct department field on invoices
- **PartsTaxable/PartsNonTax**: Revenue fields for parts
- **LaborTaxable/LaborNonTax**: Revenue fields for labor

## Common Commands
- **Frontend dev**: `cd reporting-frontend && npm run dev`
- **Backend dev**: `cd reporting-backend && python -m src.run`
- **Build frontend**: `cd reporting-frontend && npm run build`
- **Deploy**: Auto-deploys on git push (Netlify for frontend, Railway for backend)

## Performance Optimizations
1. Dashboard uses parallel query execution
2. Optimized endpoints at `/api/dashboard-optimized`
3. Redis caching ready but not currently implemented
4. Database indexes recommended for commonly queried columns

## Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Token stored in localStorage
- All API endpoints require authentication except /auth/login

## Recent Issues Fixed
1. Tooltip import conflict in ServiceReport (renamed to RechartsTooltip)
2. Technician Performance showing 0 data (changed to last 30 days)
3. Department Gross Margins calculation (fixed to use invoice-level fields)
4. Accounting Financial Performance showing mock data (fixed endpoint conflict)
5. Monthly Quotes handling duplicates (now uses latest quote per work order per month)
6. Top 10 Customers now shows percentage of total fiscal YTD sales
7. Parts reports: Added fill rate, reorder alerts, velocity analysis, demand forecasting
8. Filtered consumables (oil, grease, coolant, anti-freeze) from Top 10 Parts
9. Fixed decimal displays to show whole numbers for stock quantities

## Deployment URLs
- **Frontend**: https://softbasereports.netlify.app
- **Backend**: https://softbasereports-production.up.railway.app

## CRITICAL: API URL Usage
**NEVER hardcode backend URLs in frontend code!** Always use the `apiUrl` helper function from `@/lib/api`:

```javascript
import { apiUrl } from '@/lib/api';

// CORRECT:
const response = await fetch(apiUrl('/api/some-endpoint'));

// WRONG - NEVER DO THIS:
const response = await fetch('https://some-url.herokuapp.com/api/some-endpoint');
```

The `apiUrl` function handles:
- Local development (uses proxy)
- Production deployment (uses Netlify redirects to Railway)
- Environment-specific configuration

## Environment Variables
Backend requires:
- DATABASE_URL or individual DB connection params
- JWT_SECRET_KEY
- FLASK_ENV
- PORT (for Railway)

## Recent Features Added

### Rental Service Report (2025-07-30)
Created a comprehensive Service Report for the Rental Department showing service work orders billed to rental.

**Requirements:**
- Show total number of Service Work Orders associated with Rental Trucks
- Display list with real-time cost breakdown (Labor, Parts, Misc)
- Include sum totals at the bottom
- Service Work Orders where Rental Department is the Bill To

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Backend Endpoint**: `/api/reports/departments/rental/service-report` in `department_reports.py`
2. **Frontend Component**: `RentalServiceReport.jsx` 
3. **Access**: Available under "Service Report" tab on the Rental page

**Key Database Insights:**
- Rental service work orders are identified by SaleCode:
  - `RENTR` = Rental Repairs (SaleDept 40)
  - `RENTRS` = Rental Repairs - Shop (SaleDept 45)
- WO table uses `BillTo` field (not Customer)
- Equipment is stored in `UnitNo` field
- WOParts table doesn't have a Quantity column (use Cost directly)

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Original implementation made 100+ queries (one per work order)
- Optimized to single CTE-based query joining all cost tables
- Added optimized monthly trend query with costs/revenue
- Reduced load time from several seconds to milliseconds

**Query Structure:**
```sql
WITH RentalWOs AS (
    -- Get rental service work orders
),
LaborCosts AS (
    -- Aggregate labor costs
),
PartsCosts AS (
    -- Aggregate parts costs  
),
MiscCosts AS (
    -- Aggregate misc costs
)
-- Join everything together
```

**Diagnostic Tools Created:**
- `/api/reports/departments/rental/wo-schema` - Explores WO table structure
- `/api/reports/departments/rental/sale-codes` - Lists all sale codes
- `RentalDiagnostic.jsx` - Frontend diagnostic component (can be removed)

### Parts Inventory Table Discovery (2025-08-02)

**IMPORTANT DISCOVERY: The actual parts inventory is in the `Parts` table, NOT `NationalParts`!**

During implementation of the Parts Fill Rate report, we discovered:

1. **NationalParts table is empty** (0 rows) - This was causing all inventory queries to fail
2. **Parts table contains the actual inventory data** (11,413 rows)
3. **Parts table has the `OnHand` column** we need for inventory tracking

**Parts Table Structure:**
- `PartNo`: Part number
- `Description`: Part description  
- `OnHand`: Current inventory on hand (the key field for fill rate calculations)
- `Cost`: Part cost
- `List`: List price
- Other standard inventory fields

**WOParts Table Structure (for tracking parts orders):**
- `WONo`: Work order number
- `PartNo`: Part number ordered
- `Description`: Part description
- `Qty`: Quantity ordered
- `BOQty`: Backorder quantity (important for tracking stockouts)
- `Sell`: Selling price
- `Cost`: Cost

**Parts Fill Rate Implementation:**
The fill rate report now correctly:
1. Joins WOParts with Parts table on PartNo
2. Uses Parts.OnHand to check stock availability
3. Uses WOParts.BOQty to identify backordered items
4. Filters for Linde parts: `(PartNo LIKE 'L%' OR Description LIKE '%LINDE%')`
5. Calculates fill rate as: (Orders with stock available / Total orders) Ã— 100

**Key Learning:**
Always verify table contents before assuming based on table names. What seems like the obvious table (NationalParts for parts inventory) may not be the correct one. The Database Explorer's export functionality is invaluable for discovering the actual data structure.

### Monthly Quotes (2025-08-02)

**WOQuote Table Structure Discovery:**
The WOQuote table contains individual quote line items, not complete quotes. Key findings:
- Each row is a line item (QuoteLine field) 
- Multiple line items per work order (WONo)
- Type field indicates line type: L=Labor, P=Parts, etc.
- No Customer field - quotes are linked via work order number
- Amount field contains the dollar value for each line item

**Current Implementation:** 
Uses only the latest quote per work order per month:
```sql
WITH LatestQuotes AS (
    -- Get the latest quote date for each WO per month
    SELECT 
        YEAR(CreationTime) as year,
        MONTH(CreationTime) as month,
        WONo,
        MAX(CAST(CreationTime AS DATE)) as latest_quote_date
    FROM ben002.WOQuote
    WHERE CreationTime >= '2025-03-01'
    AND Amount > 0
    GROUP BY YEAR(CreationTime), MONTH(CreationTime), WONo
),
QuoteTotals AS (
    -- Sum all line items for each WO on its latest quote date
    SELECT 
        lq.year,
        lq.month,
        lq.WONo,
        SUM(wq.Amount) as wo_total
    FROM LatestQuotes lq
    INNER JOIN ben002.WOQuote wq
        ON lq.WONo = wq.WONo
        AND lq.year = YEAR(wq.CreationTime)
        AND lq.month = MONTH(wq.CreationTime)
        AND CAST(wq.CreationTime AS DATE) = lq.latest_quote_date
    WHERE wq.Amount > 0
    GROUP BY lq.year, lq.month, lq.WONo
)
SELECT year, month, SUM(wo_total) as amount
FROM QuoteTotals
GROUP BY year, month
```

**Benefits of this approach:**
- Each work order uses only its most recent quote within each month
- Multiple quote revisions are handled properly (only latest counts)
- Reflects the actual quote values customers are seeing
- More accurate representation of expected revenue

### Parts Management Reports (2025-08-02)

Created comprehensive parts inventory management system with multiple reports.

**Reports Implemented:**
1. **Parts Fill Rate**: Shows which Linde parts were not on hand when ordered
2. **Parts Reorder Alerts**: Identifies parts needing reorder based on usage patterns
3. **Parts Velocity Analysis**: Categorizes inventory by movement speed
4. **Parts Demand Forecast**: Predicts future demand based on historical trends
5. **Top 10 Parts by Quantity**: Shows most frequently sold parts

**Key Features:**
- Tab-based organization (Overview, Stock Alerts, Velocity, Forecast)
- Excel download functionality for all reports
- Clickable cards showing details in modal dialogs
- Hover tooltips explaining calculations
- Filtered out consumables (oil, grease, coolant, anti-freeze) from analysis

**Technical Details:**
- Fill rate calculation: (Orders with stock / Total orders) Ã— 100
- Reorder point: (Lead time + Safety stock) Ã— Average daily usage
- Velocity categories: Very Fast (>12x/year), Fast (6-12x), Medium (2-6x), Slow (0.5-2x), Very Slow (<0.5x)
- Forecast uses 12-month history with trend adjustment factors

**UI Improvements:**
- Fixed decimal displays (was showing "34.0000", now shows "34")
- Removed low-value Monthly Demand Trend card
- Default "Include Current Month" unchecked on Dashboard
- Added percentage of total sales to Top 10 Customers
