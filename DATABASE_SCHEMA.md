### Core Business Tables

#### Equipment (21,291 rows)
**Purpose**: Equipment inventory master  
**Primary Key**: SerialNo or UnitNo (both unique identifiers)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| UnitNo | nvarchar | Unit number identifier |
| SerialNo | nvarchar | Serial number (primary identifier) |
| Make | nvarchar | Equipment manufacturer |
| Model | nvarchar | Equipment model |
| ModelYear | int | Year of manufacture |
| RentalStatus | nvarchar | Current rental status (see values below) |
| Cost | decimal | Purchase cost |
| Sell | decimal | Selling price |
| Retail | decimal | Retail price |
| Customer | bit | Boolean flag (not the customer ID!) |
| CustomerNo | nvarchar | Actual customer number (join to Customer.Number) |
| DayRent | decimal | Daily rental rate |
| WeekRent | decimal | Weekly rental rate |
| MonthRent | decimal | Monthly rental rate |
| Location | nvarchar | Current location |
| InventoryDept | int | Inventory department code |
| DeletionTime | datetime | Soft delete timestamp |
| IsDeleted | bit | Deletion flag |
| WebRentalFlag | bit | Available for web rental |
| RentalYTD | decimal | Year-to-date rental revenue |
| RentalITD | decimal | Inception-to-date rental revenue |

**Important Notes**:
- NO Description field exists
- NO StockNo field exists  
- Customer field is a boolean, CustomerNo is the actual reference
- Join to Customer table using CustomerNo = Customer.Number

**Common RentalStatus Values**:
- 'Available'
- 'Ready To Rent'
- 'On Rent'
- 'Hold'
- 'Sold' (needs filtering)
- 'Disposed' (needs filtering)
- 'Transferred' (needs filtering)

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: RentalStatus field is NOT reliable for determining actual rental status!

**Inventory Department Categories** (Updated 2025-10-17):
- **Department 60**: Rental Equipment (Primary rental inventory)
- **Department 10**: New Equipment 
- **Department 20**: Used Equipment (includes batteries/chargers by keyword)
- **Department 30**: Allied Equipment

**Actual Rental Status Detection**:
The RentalStatus field is unreliable. Use this pattern instead:
```sql
-- CORRECT way to find equipment on rental
SELECT e.*, c.Name as customer_name, c.State as location_state
FROM Equipment e
LEFT JOIN Customer c ON e.CustomerNo = c.Number
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT wr.SerialNo, 1 as is_on_rental
    FROM WORental wr
    INNER JOIN WO wo ON wr.WONo = wo.WONo
    WHERE wo.Type = 'R' 
    AND wo.ClosedDate IS NULL
    AND wo.WONo NOT LIKE '9%'  -- CRITICAL: Exclude quotes!
) rental_check ON e.SerialNo = rental_check.SerialNo
WHERE e.InventoryDept = 60  -- Rental department only
AND (e.Customer = 0 OR e.Customer IS NULL)  -- Customer-owned filter
```

**Equipment Categorization Business Rules** (Updated 2025-10-17):
1. **Allied Equipment**: Keyword 'allied' in Make/Model OR InventoryDept = 30
2. **Batteries & Chargers**: Keywords 'battery', 'charger', 'batt', 'charge' in Model
3. **Rental Equipment**: InventoryDept = 60 (overrides keywords)
4. **New Equipment**: InventoryDept = 10 
5. **Used Equipment**: InventoryDept = 20 (minus batteries caught by keywords)

**QUOTES vs WORK ORDERS** (Critical Discovery):
- **Quotes**: WO numbers starting with '9' (e.g., 91600003) - NOT actual rentals
- **Work Orders**: Numbers starting with '13', '16', etc. (e.g., 130000713, 16001378)
- **Impact**: Quotes can appear in WORental with Type='R' but aren't real rentals
- **Solution**: Always filter `wo.WONo NOT LIKE '9%'` when finding rentals

---

#### Customer (2,227 rows)
**Purpose**: Customer master records  
**Primary Key**: Id (bigint)  
**Business Key**: Number (nvarchar) - USE THIS FOR JOINS

| TaxCode | nvarchar | Tax code |
| Salesman1-6 | nvarchar | Sales rep assignments |
| Contact | nvarchar | Primary contact |
| Phone1 | nvarchar | Primary phone |

**Important Notes**:
- NO Balance field - use ARDetail for AR balances
- NO YTD fields - use Sales view for YTD sales
- Always join using Number field, not Id

---

#### InvoiceReg (5,148 rows)
**Purpose**: Invoice header/register  
**Primary Key**: InvoiceNo (int)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| InvoiceNo | int | Invoice number (PK) |
| InvoiceDate | datetime | Invoice date |
| GrandTotal | decimal | Total invoice amount |
| Customer | bit | Customer flag (NOT the ID!) |
| BillTo | nvarchar | Customer number |
| BillToName | nvarchar | Customer name |

- NO Department field - use SaleCode or SaleDept
- Cost fields enable gross profit calculations

---

#### WO (Work Orders) (6,879 rows)
**Purpose**: Work order headers  
**Primary Key**: WONo (nvarchar)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| WONo | nvarchar | Work order number (PK) |
| Type | char | Order type (S=Service, R=Rental, P=Parts, I=Internal) |
| BillTo | nvarchar | Customer number |
| UnitNo | nvarchar | Equipment unit number |
| SerialNo | nvarchar | Equipment serial number |
| OpenDate | datetime | Date opened |

| ClosedDate | datetime | Date closed/invoiced |
| Technician | nvarchar | Assigned technician |
| RentalContractNo | int | Linked rental contract |
| DeletionTime | datetime | Soft delete timestamp |
| IsDeleted | bit | Deletion flag |

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY (2025-10-17): Status and Location columns DO NOT EXIST!**
- ‚ùå **Status column**: Does not exist despite documentation
- ‚ùå **Location column**: Does not exist despite documentation  
- ‚úÖ **Verified columns**: WONo, Type, BillTo, UnitNo, SerialNo, OpenDate, CompletedDate, ClosedDate, Technician

**Work Order Types**:
- **S** = Service (field service)
- **SH** = Shop (internal shop operations) - **USE THIS for shop work order filtering**
- **PM** = Preventive Maintenance (service)
- **P** = Parts only
- **R** = Rental 
- **E** = Equipment
- **I** = Internal

**üö® CRITICAL: Quote vs Work Order Detection**
**Quotes are NOT work orders but appear in WO table!**
- **Quotes**: WONo starts with '9' (e.g., 94500009, 94500032, 94500036)
- **Work Orders**: WONo starts with '1' or other digits (e.g., 140000582, 140001000, 145000017)
- **ALWAYS filter**: `WHERE WONo NOT LIKE '9%'` to exclude quotes from work order queries
- **Impact**: Without quote exclusion, you get 3x more records than expected

**Lifecycle**:
- **Open**: OpenDate set, ClosedDate NULL
- **Completed**: CompletedDate set, ClosedDate NULL (awaiting invoice)
- **Closed**: ClosedDate set (invoiced)

**Shop Work Order Filtering (Updated 2025-10-17)**:
```sql
-- CORRECT pattern for shop work orders
WHERE Type = 'SH'                -- Shop work orders only (not 'S', 'PM')  
  AND ClosedDate IS NULL         -- Open work orders only
  AND WONo NOT LIKE '9%'         -- CRITICAL: Exclude quotes!
  
-- Expected result: ~41 open shop work orders (not 955 or 102)
```

- Quoted labor for shop work orders is stored here with Type = 'L'
- The Amount column contains the quoted dollar amount
- DO NOT look for quoted labor in WOMisc - it's not there!
- Standard shop labor rate: $189/hour

**Example Query for Shop Work Order Quotes**:

**ACCOUNTING INVENTORY INSIGHTS** (Updated 2025-10-17):
**Key GL Accounts for Equipment Inventory:**
- **131000**: New Equipment (direct GL balance used)
- **131200**: Used Equipment + Batteries (requires split allocation)
- **131300**: Allied Equipment (direct GL balance used)
- **183000**: Rental Equipment Gross Value
- **193000**: Accumulated Depreciation (negative balance, subtract from 183000)

**Inventory Report Date Filtering** (Period: March 1, 2025 - October 31, 2025):
```sql
-- Standard inventory GL balance query
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(Amount), 0) as Balance
FROM GLDetail  
WHERE AccountNo = '131300'  -- or other account
  AND Posted = 1            -- CRITICAL: Only posted transactions
  AND EffectiveDate >= '2025-03-01'
  AND EffectiveDate <= '2025-10-31'
```

**GL Account Split Logic for 131200:**
- Total GL 131200 balance needs allocation between:
  - Used Equipment: ~$155,100.30 (75% allocation)
  - Batteries & Chargers: ~$52,116.39 (25% allocation)
- Logic: Based on equipment categorization by keyword analysis

**Rental Equipment Net Book Value Calculation:**
```sql
-- Rental equipment shows net book value
Rental_Net_Value = GL_183000_Balance - ABS(GL_193000_Balance)
```

**YTD Depreciation Calculation:**
```sql
-- YTD Depreciation for period March 1 - October 31, 2025
SELECT COALESCE(ABS(SUM(Amount)), 0) as YTD_Depreciation
FROM GLDetail
WHERE AccountNo = '193000'  -- Accumulated Depreciation
AND Posted = 1
AND EffectiveDate >= '2025-03-01' 
AND EffectiveDate <= '2025-10-31'
```

**CRITICAL**: Always use Posted = 1 filter and specific date ranges for accounting reports!

## Key Relationships and Join Patterns

### Customer Lookups
```sql
-- Always join Customer using Number field
FROM Equipment e
JOIN Customer c ON e.CustomerNo = c.Number

FROM InvoiceReg i
JOIN Customer c ON i.BillTo = c.Number

FROM WO w
JOIN Customer c ON w.BillTo = c.Number
```

### Rental Customer Path
```sql
-- Find actual rental customer (not owner) - UPDATED 2025-10-17
Equipment ‚Üí WORental ‚Üí WO (Type='R' AND WONo NOT LIKE '9%' AND ClosedDate IS NULL) ‚Üí Customer
```

### Equipment Rental Availability (CORRECTED PATTERN)
```sql
-- CORRECT way to determine rental availability
-- Based on "WIP > Open Rental Orders" logic in Softbase Equipment Setup
SELECT 
    e.SerialNo,
    e.Make,
    e.Model,
    CASE 
        WHEN rental_check.is_on_rental = 1 THEN 'On Rental'
        ELSE 'Available'
    END as rental_status,
    c.Name as customer_name,
    c.State as location_state
FROM Equipment e
LEFT JOIN Customer c ON e.CustomerNo = c.Number
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        wr.SerialNo,
        1 as is_on_rental
    FROM WORental wr
    INNER JOIN WO wo ON wr.WONo = wo.WONo
    WHERE wo.Type = 'R' 
    AND wo.ClosedDate IS NULL        -- Open work orders only
    AND wo.WONo NOT LIKE '9%'        -- Exclude quotes
) rental_check ON e.SerialNo = rental_check.SerialNo
WHERE e.InventoryDept = 60           -- Rental department equipment only
AND (e.Customer = 0 OR e.Customer IS NULL)  -- Exclude customer-owned
```

### Equipment Categorization for Inventory Reports
```sql
-- Business rules for equipment categorization (Updated 2025-10-17)
CASE 
    -- Keyword overrides (highest priority)
    WHEN LOWER(e.Make) LIKE '%allied%' OR LOWER(e.Model) LIKE '%allied%' THEN 'allied'
    WHEN LOWER(e.Model) LIKE '%battery%' OR LOWER(e.Model) LIKE '%charger%' 
         OR LOWER(e.Model) LIKE '%batt%' OR LOWER(e.Model) LIKE '%charge%' THEN 'batteries_chargers'
    
    -- Department-based categorization (secondary)
    WHEN e.InventoryDept = 60 THEN 'rental'
    WHEN e.InventoryDept = 10 THEN 'new'
    WHEN e.InventoryDept = 30 THEN 'allied'
    WHEN e.InventoryDept = 20 THEN 'used'
    
    -- Default fallback
    ELSE 'used'
END as equipment_category
```

### Work Order Costs
```sql
-- Get complete work order costs
SELECT 
    w.WONo,
    SUM(l.Sell * l.Hours) as LaborSell,
    SUM(p.Sell * p.Qty) as PartsSell,  -- Note: Multiply by Qty!
    SUM(m.Sell) as MiscSell
FROM WO w
LEFT JOIN WOLabor l ON w.WONo = l.WONo
LEFT JOIN WOParts p ON w.WONo = p.WONo
LEFT JOIN WOMisc m ON w.WONo = m.WONo
GROUP BY w.WONo
```

### Shop Work Order Cost Overrun Detection (NEW - 2025-10-18)
```sql
-- Monitor actual vs quoted labor hours for shop work orders
SELECT 
    w.WONo,
    w.BillTo as CustomerNo,
    c.Name as CustomerName,
    
    -- Quoted labor from WOQuote table (NOT WOMisc!)
    COALESCE(quoted.QuotedAmount, 0) as QuotedAmount,
    CASE 
        WHEN quoted.QuotedAmount > 0 THEN quoted.QuotedAmount / 189.0
        ELSE 0
    END as QuotedHours,
    
    -- Actual labor hours from WOLabor
    COALESCE(SUM(l.Hours), 0) as ActualHours,
    
    -- Cost overrun percentage
    CASE 
        WHEN quoted.QuotedAmount IS NULL OR quoted.QuotedAmount = 0 THEN 0
        ELSE (COALESCE(SUM(l.Hours), 0) / (quoted.QuotedAmount / 189.0)) * 100
    END as PercentUsed

FROM [ben002].WO w
LEFT JOIN [ben002].Customer c ON w.BillTo = c.Number
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT WONo, SUM(Amount) as QuotedAmount
    FROM [ben002].WOQuote
    WHERE Type = 'L'  -- L = Labor quotes
    GROUP BY WONo
) quoted ON w.WONo = quoted.WONo
LEFT JOIN [ben002].WOLabor l ON w.WONo = l.WONo

WHERE w.Type = 'SH'  -- Shop work orders only
  AND w.ClosedDate IS NULL
  AND w.WONo NOT LIKE '9%'  -- Exclude quotes

GROUP BY w.WONo, w.BillTo, c.Name, quoted.QuotedAmount
```

**Key Insights**:
- Standard shop labor rate: $189/hour
- Quoted amounts stored in WOQuote.Amount column, NOT WOMisc.Sell
- Alert levels: CRITICAL ‚â•100%, RED ‚â•90%, YELLOW ‚â•80%, GREEN <80%
- Hours at Risk = Sum of (ActualHours - QuotedHours) for CRITICAL/RED work orders
- Unbillable Labor Value = Hours at Risk √ó $189
```

### Current Rentals
```sql
-- Find equipment currently on rent
SELECT e.*, rh.DaysRented, rh.RentAmount
FROM Equipment e
JOIN RentalHistory rh ON e.SerialNo = rh.SerialNo
WHERE rh.Year = YEAR(GETDATE())
  AND rh.Month = MONTH(GETDATE())
  AND rh.DaysRented > 0
```

### AR Aging
```sql
-- Correct AR aging pattern
WITH InvoiceBalances AS (
    SELECT 
        CustomerNo,
        InvoiceNo,
        MIN(Due) as DueDate,  -- Use MIN to get single date
        SUM(Amount) as Balance
    FROM ARDetail
    WHERE HistoryFlag IS NULL OR HistoryFlag = 0
    GROUP BY CustomerNo, InvoiceNo  -- NOT by Due date!
    HAVING SUM(Amount) > 0.01
)
-- Then calculate aging buckets...
```

## Common Gotchas and Important Notes (UPDATED 2025-10-17)

### Critical Database Rules
1. **Customer Joins**: ALWAYS use Customer.Number, never Customer.Id
2. **Parts Calculations**: Always multiply WOParts.Sell * Qty for extended amounts
3. **AR Grouping**: Group by CustomerNo and InvoiceNo only, NOT by Due date
4. **Equipment.Customer**: This is a boolean flag, not the customer reference
5. **InvoiceReg.Customer**: Also a boolean flag, use BillTo for customer number
6. **Parts Table**: Use Parts table, NOT NationalParts (which is empty)
7. **Deletion Flags**: Check both DeletionTime and IsDeleted fields
8. **Work Order Status**: Use ClosedDate IS NULL for open orders

### NEW CRITICAL DISCOVERIES (2025-10-17)
9. **üö® RentalStatus Field is UNRELIABLE**: Don't trust Equipment.RentalStatus for rental detection
10. **üö® Quotes vs Work Orders**: ALWAYS filter `WONo NOT LIKE '9%'` to exclude quotes from rental detection
11. **üö® GLDetail Filtering**: ALWAYS include `Posted = 1` filter for accounting reports
12. **üö® Inventory Department Logic**: Department 60 = Rental, 10 = New, 20 = Used, 30 = Allied
13. **üö® Equipment Categorization**: Keywords override department for Allied/Batteries classification
14. **üö® GL Account 131200**: Requires manual split between Used Equipment and Batteries (~75%/25%)
15. **üö® Rental Net Book Value**: Use GL 183000 - ABS(GL 193000) for accurate rental asset values
16. **üö® Date Range Filtering**: Accounting reports use March 1, 2025 - October 31, 2025 period
17. **üö® Excel Export Issues**: Avoid variable name conflicts in iteration loops (category_info vs category_definitions)
18. **üö® WO.Status Column DOESN'T EXIST**: Despite documentation, Status column is not in WO table
19. **üö® WO.Location Column DOESN'T EXIST**: Despite documentation, Location column is not in WO table
20. **üö® Shop Work Order Detection**: Use Type = 'SH' for shop work orders (not Type IN ('S', 'SH', 'PM'))
21. **üö® Quote Contamination in WO Table**: WONo starting with '9' are quotes, not work orders - ALWAYS exclude
22. **üö® Quoted Labor Location**: Quoted labor amounts are in WOQuote table (Type='L'), NOT in WOMisc!
23. **üö® WOQuote Column Names**: Use 'Amount' column for quoted values, not 'Sell' or 'ExtendedPrice'
24. **üö® Standard Shop Labor Rate**: $189/hour used for converting quoted amounts to hours

### Work Order Query Rules (NEW - 2025-10-17)
- **NEVER** assume Status or Location columns exist in WO table
- **ALWAYS** exclude quotes with `WONo NOT LIKE '9%'` for ANY work order query
- **ALWAYS** use Type = 'SH' specifically for shop work orders (not broader Type filters)
- **ALWAYS** verify column existence before using in queries
- **Quote Impact**: Without quote exclusion, work order counts can be 2-3x higher than expected

### Rental Availability Detection Rules
- **NEVER** use Equipment.RentalStatus alone
- **ALWAYS** check for open rental work orders in WORental/WO join
- **ALWAYS** exclude quotes with `WONo NOT LIKE '9%'`
- **ALWAYS** filter to InventoryDept = 60 for rental equipment
- **ALWAYS** exclude customer-owned equipment with Customer = 0 filter

### GL Account Balance Rules for Inventory
- Use specific date ranges (not "current balance")
- Always filter Posted = 1 transactions
- Account for depreciation in rental equipment calculations
- Split GL 131200 between Used Equipment and Batteries categories
- Use net book value for rental equipment display totals

## Data Quality Issues (UPDATED 2025-10-17)

### Legacy Issues (Still Present)
- Some equipment marked as "Sold" still appears in inventory
- RentalStatus values are inconsistent and unreliable
- Not all sold units have consistent status marking
- Some units have rental rates but aren't actually for rent

### RESOLVED Issues (Solutions Found)
- ‚úÖ **Equipment.InventoryDept**: NOW RELIABLE for primary categorization (Dept 60=Rental, 10=New, 20=Used, 30=Allied)
- ‚úÖ **Rental Detection**: Solution found using WORental + WO join with quote exclusion
- ‚úÖ **GL Account Balancing**: Proper date filtering and Posted=1 requirements documented
- ‚úÖ **Equipment Categorization**: Business rules established with keyword overrides

### NEW Issues Discovered (2025-10-17)
- **Quote Contamination**: Quotes appear in WORental table and must be filtered out
- **GL 131200 Split**: No systematic way to split between Used Equipment and Batteries (manual allocation required)
- **Depreciation Calculation**: Complex interaction between GL 183000 and 193000 for rental assets
- **Date Range Dependencies**: Accounting reports depend on specific fiscal period filters

## Major System Insights (2025-10-17)

### Rental Availability Discovery
**Key Learning**: "Never assume data values - always verify actual database content"
- The RentalStatus field was completely unreliable for rental detection
- Solution required analysis of actual Softbase Equipment Setup screen logic
- Critical discovery: Quotes vs Work Orders distinction essential for accuracy

### Equipment Categorization Discovery  
**Key Learning**: Department-based categorization works but requires keyword overrides
- Department 60 provides clean data for rental equipment
- Keyword analysis required for Allied equipment and Batteries/Chargers
- Categorization used for display lists, GL balances used for financial totals

### GL Account Balance Discovery
**Key Learning**: Equipment book values ‚â† GL account balances for financial reporting
- Dollar amounts MUST come from GL account balances, not equipment Cost fields
- Different logic for different categories (direct GL vs calculated net book value)
- Specific date range filtering essential for period-accurate reporting

### Excel Export Technical Discovery
**Key Learning**: Variable name conflicts can cause silent failures
- Python iteration variable name conflicts caused corrupted Excel files
- BytesIO handling requires proper stream positioning
- Flask send_file requires specific MIME types and headers

### WO Table Schema Discovery (NEW - 2025-10-17)
**Key Learning**: Documentation severely mismatches actual table structure
- **Status Column**: Documented but DOESN'T EXIST - caused SQL errors
- **Location Column**: Documented but DOESN'T EXIST - caused SQL errors  
- **Quote Contamination**: WONo starting with '9' are quotes masquerading as work orders
- **Shop Work Orders**: Type = 'SH' specifically (not broader Type IN ('S', 'SH', 'PM'))
- **Impact**: Without proper filtering, work order counts 2-3x higher than expected

### WOQuote Table Discovery (NEW - 2025-10-18)  
**Key Learning**: Quoted labor amounts are NOT stored where expected
- **Initial Assumption**: Quoted labor would be in WOMisc table - WRONG!
- **Discovery Process**: Created multiple debug endpoints to search for $3,938 quote
- **Solution Found**: WOQuote table stores all quoted amounts with Type codes
- **Type Codes**: L=Labor, P=Parts, M=Miscellaneous
- **Column Name**: Use 'Amount' column, not 'Sell' or other common names
- **Business Impact**: Enabled Cash Burn report with unbillable labor value calculations
- **Hours at Risk**: Can now calculate exact hours over budget and dollar impact

**Pattern Recognition**: Same quote exclusion logic needed across the system:
- ‚úÖ **Rental Work Orders**: Fixed with `WONo NOT LIKE '9%'`
- ‚úÖ **Shop Work Orders**: Fixed with `WONo NOT LIKE '9%'`
- üéØ **Future Work Order Queries**: ALWAYS exclude quotes

**Column Verification Process**: 
1. Never trust documentation for column existence
2. Test queries with minimal column sets first
3. Add columns incrementally to verify existence
4. Document actual working column combinations
