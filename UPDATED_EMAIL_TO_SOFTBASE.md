Subject: Re: Azure SQL Connection - Firewall Blocking ALL External Access

Hi Greg,

I've tested the Azure SQL credentials you provided from multiple locations, and I'm getting consistent firewall errors. The credentials appear to be correct, but Azure SQL is blocking ALL external connections, not just from our cloud servers.

## Test Results:

### 1. From Railway (Cloud Host):
- **Blocked IP**: 162.220.234.11
- **Error Code**: 40615
- **Message**: "Cannot open server 'evo1-sql-replica' requested by the login. Client with IP address '162.220.234.11' is not allowed to access the server."

### 2. From My Local Development Machine:
- **Blocked IP**: 97.127.83.142
- **Error Code**: 40615 (same error)
- **Message**: "Cannot open server 'evo1-sql-replica' requested by the login. Client with IP address '97.127.83.142' is not allowed to access the server."

## What This Means:

The Azure SQL Server firewall is configured to block ALL external IP addresses. When you said the credentials would "just work," it seems the firewall configuration may have been overlooked. This is a common Azure SQL security setting, but it prevents any external application from connecting.

## Connection Details We're Using:
```
Server: evo1-sql-replica.database.windows.net
Database: evo
Username: ben002user
Password: [As provided]
```

## Solution Needed:

Please implement ONE of the following:

1. **Enable "Allow Azure services and resources to access this server"**
   - In Azure Portal → SQL Server → Networking
   - This allows connections from Azure-hosted services
   - Most common solution for cloud applications

2. **Add specific IP addresses** (not recommended)
   - Add: 97.127.83.142 (my development machine)
   - Add: 162.220.234.0/24 (Railway IP range)
   - Note: IPs change, so this isn't sustainable

3. **Provide alternative access method**
   - REST API endpoint
   - Different server with open access
   - VPN credentials

## Why This Is Critical:

Without resolving this firewall configuration, we cannot:
- Connect from ANY location (local or cloud)
- Access any Softbase Evolution data
- Build the reporting features you need
- Test or develop the application

The error is very specific: **Azure SQL Error 40615** indicates the firewall is blocking our IPs. This is not a credential issue - the credentials are correct, but the server won't allow connections from external IP addresses.

Could you please check with your Azure administrator to enable one of the solutions above? Option 1 (allowing Azure services) is typically the quickest and is standard practice for cloud applications.

I've attached the full error logs from both environments as proof of the firewall blocking.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your name]

## Error Log Evidence:

### Local Machine Test (Blocked):
```
Error Code: 40615
Blocked IP: 97.127.83.142
Message: "Cannot open server 'evo1-sql-replica' requested by the login. 
Client with IP address '97.127.83.142' is not allowed to access the server."
```

### Railway Cloud Test (Blocked):
```
Error Code: 40615
Blocked IP: 162.220.234.11
Message: "Cannot open server 'evo1-sql-replica' requested by the login. 
Client with IP address '162.220.234.11' is not allowed to access the server."
```

Both tests show the same Azure SQL firewall error (40615), proving that ALL external connections are being blocked.
