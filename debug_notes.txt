KEY FINDING: The 13-month trailing logic issue

In fiscal_year.py, get_fiscal_year_months():
1. It calculates 13 trailing months correctly (Feb 2025 = current, so Jan 2025 through Feb 2026)
2. BUT it then calls get_tenant_cutover_date() which returns:
   - g.current_organization.data_start_date if set
   - None if data_start_date is NULL (no restriction)
   - DEFAULT_CUTOVER_DATE = datetime(2025, 3, 1) if no org context

The problem: For IPS (or whichever tenant this is), the data_start_date in the database
might be set to 2025-02-01 or 2025-03-01, which would filter out January 2025.

OR: The g.current_organization might not be set properly, causing it to fall through
to DEFAULT_CUTOVER_DATE = March 1, 2025.

Current date: Feb 9, 2026
13 trailing months: Feb 2025 through Feb 2026
Chart shows: Feb '25 through Feb '26 (12 months, missing Jan '25)

Wait - the chart DOES start at Feb '25. That's 13 months (Feb '25 through Feb '26 = 13 months).
Actually: Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb = 13 months.

So the chart IS showing 13 months. The user might be expecting Jan '25 to be included.

Let me re-count: Feb '25, Mar '25, Apr '25, May '25, Jun '25, Jul '25, Aug '25, Sep '25, Oct '25, Nov '25, Dec '25, Jan '26, Feb '26 = 13 months.

That IS 13 trailing months. The issue is that 13 trailing months from Feb 2026 starts at Feb 2025, not Jan 2025.

BUT WAIT - the user said "That's not 13 months trailing" - maybe they want Jan '25 included, making it 14 months? Or maybe the chart is only showing 12 months?

Looking at the screenshot: Feb '25, May '25, Aug '25, Nov '25, Feb '26 are the visible x-axis labels.
The bars between them would be: Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb = 13 bars.

Actually the user might be right that it should start at Jan '25 for a true 13 trailing months.
13 months back from Feb 2026 = Feb 2025 (12 months back) + current month = 13 months.

Hmm, but if the user expects Jan '25, they might want the data_start_date to be NULL (no restriction)
and the trailing months to be calculated as: current month - 12 months = Feb 2025.

Wait, I need to re-read the code more carefully.

In get_fiscal_year_months:
  start_date = as_of_date - relativedelta(months=trailing_months - 1)
  For trailing_months=13, as_of_date=Feb 9, 2026:
  start_date = Feb 2026 - 12 months = Feb 2025
  Then generates: Feb 2025, Mar 2025, ..., Feb 2026 = 13 months

So the math IS correct for 13 trailing months. Feb '25 through Feb '26 = 13 months.

The user might be confused, or they might want 14 months, or the chart might actually be showing fewer months due to cutover filtering.

Let me check: if data_start_date is set to 2025-03-01 for this org, then Jan and Feb 2025 would be filtered out, leaving only Mar '25 through Feb '26 = 12 months.

But the chart shows Feb '25 as the first month, so data_start_date must be 2025-02-01 or earlier.

Actually, looking more carefully at the screenshot - I count the bars:
Feb '25, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan '26, Feb '26 = 13 bars.

That IS 13 months. But the user says it's not. Maybe they want it to start at Jan '25 (14 months)?

OR: Maybe this is for IPS which has data_start_date = NULL, and the user expects the full 13 months to start from Jan '25 because IPS's fiscal year starts in January.

The user said "the data starts in Feb 2025. That's not 13 trailing months" - they're saying the first data point should be earlier than Feb '25 for a true 13 trailing months.

Actually wait - 13 trailing months from the current month (Feb 2026) would be:
Feb 2025 (month -12), Mar 2025 (month -11), ..., Jan 2026 (month -1), Feb 2026 (month 0)
= 13 months total. This IS correct.

Unless the user wants the 13 months to NOT include the current incomplete month, in which case:
Jan 2025 through Jan 2026 = 13 complete months, plus Feb 2026 partial = 14 data points.

I think the user wants Jan '25 included. Let me check if the issue is the cutover date filtering.
